Managing the number of emails to send: The ability to specify the number of emails to be sent in a given time period gives users the power to control their email traffic and prevent excessive pressure on the server.

Loading email lists: The user can add their own email lists to the plugin, which makes the process of managing recipients and scheduling emails very easy.
