## Dark/Light Mode
508 Dark Mode is a lightweight WordPress plugin that adds a smooth, user-controlled dark mode to any website using the powerful DarkReader engine.
Unlike heavy theme-based solutions, this plugin works independently from your design system and applies dark mode dynamically on the client side — without modifying your theme styles.
### ✨ Features
- Adds dark mode support to any WordPress site
- Uses DarkReader for high-quality rendering
- Remembers user preference via localStorage
- Works with any theme or page builder
- Includes a ready-to-use shortcode [508_dark_mode]
- Optional automatic injection into mobile menu
- Clean toggle UI with animated switch
- Loads DarkReader early to prevent flash of light theme

Setting the time to send emails: Users can set a specific time to send emails, which is very useful for scheduling email campaigns.
Managing the number of emails to send: The ability to specify the number of emails to be sent in a given time period gives users the power to control their email traffic and prevent excessive pressure on the server.
Using server email sending functions: This plugin intelligently uses the internal functions of the server to send emails, which helps reduce technical complexity.
Loading email lists: The user can add their own email lists to the plugin, which makes the process of managing recipients and scheduling emails very easy.
